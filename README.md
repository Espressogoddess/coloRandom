### Learning Goals:

- Navigate a group project enviroment.
- Problem Solving with new challenges.
- Continue and gain a deeper understanding with CSS, Javascript, and HTML. 

### Wins + Challenges:

1. A big win was when we were struggling to figure out how to get a new palette with random colors in it. 
  - We ended up making a function that used a string of the all the possible characters to use and then used a for loop to run Math.floor and Math.random. 
2.  A big win was when we achieved the ability to toggle both the color and the changing of the lock icon after the user clicks on the color box they would like to save. 
  - We used problem solving and actually took time away from the group setting to achieve this breakthrough.
